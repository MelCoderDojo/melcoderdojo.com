Just settling in after the first day at the Melvindale Street Fair. It was a long one, but I was glad to be out there.

I'd like to take the chance to hit on a few questions that seemed to come up throughout the day, both while I was there and while I wasn't.

**Is this for anybody?**

<!--more-->

Pretty much, yes! Although the worldwide CoderDojo program focuses on youth and so we aim at K-12 students, I don't want to turn away anyone because of their age. I want to help anyone interested in learning however I can.

At least at this dojo, you can't be "too old".

What I do expect from adults more so than the rest is taking part in helping others learn. In truth, even the kids are going to be helping each other learn as they go, and so what you'll do will not be all that much different.

"In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn." I can't quote that _Tarzan_ song enough. You will learn in trying to help others learn. Even if you come to the dojo knowing "nothing", as you learn, you will have something to teach to someone else. You will start understanding and thinking, and who knows what problems you'll be able to solve!

We're not a school, we're a club, and we're in this together. :smile:

**Where is this at?**

So far, we meet at the Melvindale Public Library. There is no special reservation or anything like that, we just show up and do our stuff. Check out the [About page]({{ site.url }}/about) for more details, including what gear you need to bring.

**How often do you meet?**

Right now, I'm shooting for once a month, with the chosen day being the second Wednesday of the month. (Wednesday is the least busy day at the library, I'm told.)

I am interested in doing this more often and even on different days, depending on getting more members and more volunteers to help. Once a month is just the minimum.

Alright, those are the ones that stand out in my mind. I hope I've cleared those up here if you were wondering about any of these questions or similar. :smile:
