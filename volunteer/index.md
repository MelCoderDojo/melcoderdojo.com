A CoderDojo runs completely on volunteers. Even if you're not technical, if you'd like to play a part, there's probably something you can help with.

Mentoring makes for a great opportunity for those familiar with code, be they college students or otherwise, to:

 * Give back to the community
 * Inspire the next generation
 * Use your skills to have fun and be creative
 * Learn from the kids and teens
 * Develop teaching, mentoring, and communication skills
 * Meet other mentors with similar creative and socially aware tendencies
 * Try something new

If you're interested in getting involved, contact CoderDojo Melvindale and let us know.
