After much thought, CoderDojo Melvindale will be going into a stasis until further notice.

<!--more-->

I have put much time and effort into getting this dojo going, but for one reason or another, it has not taken off. I don't know whether it is due to a fear of not knowing enough to participate or volunteer (despite people showing interest), people not realizing there are extra laptops they can use, or if there is some other reason.

I've found myself feeling like I need to convince people to be interested, but then I remember that a younger me would've jumped at the chance to take part. Though I want to help anyone who is even a tiny bit interested, those who really wish they had such a learning opportunity (which is lacking in today's education system) are the ones I really started this for. And despite what the CoderDojo standard is, the age didn't really matter to me.

I don't consider this a wasted effort. I learned a lot in putting this all together, and in doing that, I was led to an awesome job which allows me to do pretty much what I wanted to accomplish with the dojo--just not in my own backyard. Sometimes, things just work out in a way differently than we originally intended. That's all it is.

Until others step forward to participate and volunteer, I will turn my focus toward people who actively seek help in their learning. It's more to give to the people who are there to accept it.

A big thanks to all those who put even the smallest effort in helping out the dojo and gave me support. It's much appreciated.

If anyone in the area is interested in learning about code and technology, let me know! Even if there is only one person, I will find a way to help. I don't know everything, but I'll do what I can to point you in the right direction.

Code on!
