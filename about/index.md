"CoderDojo is a global network of volunteer-led, independent, community based programming clubs for young people. These young people, between 7 and 17, learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology. In addition to learning to code attendees meet like minded people and get to show off what theyâ€™ve been working on." -- [CoderDojo website](https://coderdojo.com/about/)

CoderDojo Melvindale is bringing this movement to the Little City with a Big Heart. Any student in grades K-12 may participate, though those on the younger end may need extra assistance from their parent.


### Location ###

We'll be using the Melvindale Public Library to hold our monthly meetings on the second Wednesday of every month. No space is reserved, we're simply making use of what's open like any other patrons. Just show up and head for the Study & Magazine Room.

### Gear ###

Participants (aka ninja) should bring:

 * A laptop
 * A pair of headphones
 * An email address
 * A parent, if under 13 (teenage siblings, other adults, etc. are also fine)

If you have issues with bringing any of the list, feel free to [contact us]({{ site.url }}/contact) about it.

We have a few laptops available for use, but they'll go on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please bring your own laptop or borrow one if you can.

Ninja may need an email address to create an account for saving progress. If you use a laptop that isn't yours, you may also want a USB flash drive to save your data onto. It really depends on what you end up working on.
