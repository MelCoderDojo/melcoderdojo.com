Hiya visitors, this is the founder of CoderDojo Melvindale writing to you. My name is Stacy.

CoderDojo Melvindale has a booth at the upcoming Melvindale Street Fair! There probably won't be anything too fancy, given that only the food trucks get access to electricity, but if you would like to talk to me about the dojo and see if it's something you or someone you know might be interested in, it's a great chance to. The days are August 1st and 2nd, and I'll try to be at the booth as much as possible myself.

If any issues come up, I'll be sure to post them up on <a href="http://twitter.com/MelCoderDojo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> asap, so keep an eye over there.

Although the overall CoderDojo foundation aims at helping youth learn to code and about technology, I welcome adults interesting in learning to join in. Just be willing to help others out as you learn, as best as you can, which is a great way to learn really. "In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn," as the song goes. I could always use more mentors and volunteers of any skill level!

In other news, as previously announced on Twitter and Facebook, the next scheduled day for our dojo meetup is September 9th, starting at 5pm and running to 7pm at the latest. Be sure to bring your gear! You can read more about how things work and what you need on the <a href="http://melcoderdojo.com/about" target="_blank">About page</a>, and if you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us on Twitter or on our <a href="http://melcoderdojo.com/contact">Contact page</a>.

I'll wrap up this post here. Keep enjoying your summer! I hope to see or hear from you soon.
